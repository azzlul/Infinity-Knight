# Infinity-Knight
    My first game project, started around February of 2022 and finished in September of 2024, although the game was in active development for only about 3 months.<br/>
    I started this project to challenge myself and prove I could pursue game development as a career, and that I could learn all aspects of making a game, from writing the code to designing the game and creating its assets.<br/>
    Short of the font(Edit Undo by Ã†nigma), every asset in the game is made by me, including code, 2D and 3D assets, music, and sound effects. It was my first time creating anything of the sort(except for code), so I had to learn as I went. As a result a lot of it is not of the greatest quality, but my goal was not to make an amazing or even a good game, my goal was to make a game and to finish making that game, which I succeded in doing.<br/>
    If you wish to play the game, you can find it [here](https://azzlul.itch.io/infinity-knight) <br/>
